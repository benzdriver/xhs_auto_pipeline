      "full_content": "The most recent Express Entry draw results under the Provincial Nominee Program have been announced by the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada.\n\nOn 12 May, 511 Express Entry invitations were issued to eligible foreign nationals, with the lowest-ranked candidate receiving a CRS score of 706. Date and time of round was May 12, 2025 at 14:14:40 UTC, while the Tie-breaking rule date was March 04, 2025 at 22:35:42 UTC. This means the Rank required to be invited to apply will be 511 or above.\n\nIf more than one candidate has the lowest score, the cut-off is based on the date and time they submitted their Express Entry profiles.\n\nThe previous draw under the Provincial Nominee Program was conducted on April 28, 2025, when 421 Express Entry invitations were issued to eligible foreign nationals ranked among the first, with the lowest-ranked candidate receiving a CRS score of 727.\n\nThe Canadian federal administration employs the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to sort applicants according to elements such as age, educational background, employment history, and proficiency in languages, adjusting the threshold for each Express Entry draw.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Canada withdrew \u2018job offer points\u2019 from the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) in the Express Entry pool. This will apply to both current and future candidates. The removal of \u2018job offer points\u2019 from the Comprehensive Ranking System will not apply to all categories, but only to those that are classified under Major Group 00 of the National Occupation Classification (for example, senior management positions) (200 points) and in any other skilled occupation (50 points).\n\nCandidates with qualifying job offers in their Express Entry profiles will lose their previously associated CRS points. In contrast, those with a current job offer will no longer have the opportunity to earn extra points after March 25, 2025.\n\nForeigners who want to live in Canada can apply for Canadian Permanent Resident status through the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). This program allows people to live, reside, and work in a certain province or region. A permanent resident (PR) is someone who has been given PR status by immigrating to Canada, but is not a Canadian citizen. PRs are usually citizens of other countries, while some may be stateless persons.\n\nThe Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) in Canada allow provinces and territories to select immigrants for permanent residency. There are several different PNP streams in Canada. PNPs select candidates based on criteria such as having a job offer in the province, working in an in-demand occupation, having previous work or study experience in the province, or having the resources to start a business in the province.\n\nThe Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) is created for employees possessing the required abilities, education, and employment background to enhance the economy of a particular province or territory and to settle permanently in Canada. Every province and territory has its unique immigration schemes aimed at particular categories, including students, entrepreneurs, skilled employees, or workers with some skills.\n\nTo obtain a Canada PR via PNP, follow these steps: determine eligibility and requirements for available PNPs, complete the application process, submit it to the territory or province, and receive an official Provincial Nomination certificate if eligible, allowing you to proceed to the next step.\n\nCanada Express Entry is a program for skilled immigrants seeking permanent residency in Canada, managed by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) under various programs such as the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class, Federal Skilled Trades Program, and Provincial Nominee Program.\n\nCRS score distribution of candidates in the pool as of May 12, 2025\n\nThe numbers in this table reflect the total number of people in the pool overall, a few days before an invitation round. The score distribution may change as people submit new profiles and other profiles expire.\n\nThe table numbers not in bold are a detailed breakdown of the bold number immediately above.",
